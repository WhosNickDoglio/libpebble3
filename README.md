# libpebble3
A port/rewrite of [libpebble2](https://github.com/pebble/libpebble2/) to Kotlin Multiplatform with additional features useful for watch companion apps

![Build](https://github.com/crc-32/libpebblecommon/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

# Guidelines

- We share a version catalog with CoreApp to avoid duplicating definitions. This means a few extra library entries which are not used in libpebble (so they can share the version definition).
- Use `optIn` in `build.gradle.kts` rather than individual source files.
- Only use injected coroutine scopes: either LibPebbleCoroutineScope (insteads of GlobalScope) or ConnectionCoroutineScope (scoped per-connection).

Connection:
- Services are scoped to the connection. Their main job is to translate raw pebble protocol messages to something readable by the rest of the app.
- Endpoint managers are also scoped to the connection, and manage complex state around services.
